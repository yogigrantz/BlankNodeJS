# BlankNodeJS
This project contains a basic NodeJS Backend and NodeJS FrontEnd defined in one file, app.js. 
The BackEnd will accept Get, Post, Put, Delete, and Upload File from the Front End.
The Front End, index.html, contains AngularJS to post and upload file to the Backend.
The Uploaded file is stored in the /uploads folder.

The process does not stop here. This is just a Blank solution to start the project. More endpoints 
can be added, and MySQL stored procedure calls can be implemented within the endpoints. Also the File 
Uploads can be used for batch record processing in addition to storing images in a file folder and / or 
in database.
